# filetree
A filetree for r/datacurator

Hello and welcome to the [r/datacurator](https://reddit.com/r/datacurator) filetree repository.  

We aim to create a unified filetree for all kinds of data, for making it easier to store, categorise and retrieve it.

This filetree is primarily based on the categorisation of data into directories based on the form of the data involved. For example, if a file is a .mp3 or .wav file, it would then be sorted into the audio top-level section. However, within subsections, the data is usually categorised based on category. If the previously mentioned audio file was a piece of music, it would be sorted into the artists subsection. However, if it was an audiobook, it would be sorted into the books subsection.
