## Patterns

One of the most common file naming schemes is the use of the date in ISO8601 format at the start of the name (i.e YYYY-MM-DD) followed by a dash and then a useful name for the file. These names should be appropriately descriptive and formatted in an easily readable manner that allow it to be distinguished from other documents in the same subsection.
