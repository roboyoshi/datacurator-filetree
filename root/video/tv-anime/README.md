# TV-Anime

> Since anime often follows the season/cour pattern, it can be split off into it's own section here.

## Naming

This can be handled at will, we currently do not provide a proper structure for this.

What I can recommend though is aggregating the releases into one main folder for the series and putting all batches/cours into that.

```md
Main Anime Aggregate/
    Individual Seasons/Cours/Releases
```

for example:

```md
Attack on Titan/
    Shingeki no Kyojin S3 (38-49) [1080p]
    Shingeki no Kyojin S3 (50-59) [1080p]
    Attack.on.Titan.BD.1080p.DL.DTS.x264-GRP
```
