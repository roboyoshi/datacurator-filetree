## TV-Shows

**Things to consider:**

* Merging TV Series with Anime and Animated Content, since they both are broadcasted on national TV, as well as on VOD Services.
* use internationalized name. ('Shingeki No Kyojin' is 'Attack on Titan')
* CAN be split further if people like to split their libraries. (Anime/Cartoon/TV/Kids/..)
* Appending Years is almost always a good Idea (as with movies) - there might be multiple variants.. (Matching with DB seems to be a bit off though..)


There is a good reason why Anime is often split - because the Naming differs in a kinda uncomfortable way. See Attack on Titan For Example - Season 2 is actually considered a new Series and Just named as "season 2". But at the Same Time the Episode Count just keeps going up instead of being reset.  

Sherlock on the other Hand has a Classic Season / Episode Structure that is much easier to follow.  

* We need to find a structure that either sqauashes one into the other, or keep it seperate.

Also to keep in mind:

In the United States, a TV show is a single episode of television. Both the X Factor and Friends are comprised of shows. Friends has half hour television shows. The X Factor generally has one hour shows. There may be longer shows due to a season finale or special event. The broadcast of the Super Bowl is a TV show that lasts many hours.

To confuse matters a bit, "show" can be used as a collective noun to describe all of the episodes of a program. Friends is a show. X Factor is a show. The individual airings/episodes of Friends and X Factor can also be called shows.

Again in the United States, a television "season" is a grouping of television episodes. The season is often delineated by a time period. A typical situation comedy in the US (like Friends) is a collection of 22 or 24 shows, initially broadcast/aired over the course of several months. (Often September of one year to May of the next year, but there are many exceptions to this.) A television season could also be a group of shows/episodes released all at once, like Netflix offering a season of House of Cards all at the same time.

Still talking about the United States ... A television "series" is all of the shows (episodes) of a program. Friends is a TV series/show which had 236 episodes broadcast over 10 seasons.

In the UK, the terminology is different. They use "series" to mean what we in the US would probably call "seasons." In the UK they'd say that Lady Mary had a baby in "Series Three" of Downton Abbey. In the US, we'd say that Lady Mary had the baby in "Season Three."
