## Content

*There is a wide range of types:*

Movies, Movie Shorts, Music Videos, Tv-Shows, Documentaries, learning/tutorials, webisodes, dvd extras (making of), real-live captures, vlogs, let's plays, and more..  

The most important are probably Movies and TV-Shows

- Should not be splitted too far
- TV Shows and Anime ? Together in 1 Directory or splitted?
- TV Shows and Web-Series (Youtube Series, inofficial stuff) - splitted?

## Patterns

→ Currently we use 'movies' because it's more widely adapted instead of 'film'

→ `Short Films` should be integrated into the `movies` folder, but can also be put into a seperate `movie-shorts` or `shorts` directory. If really necessary even `short-films` would work.

## Multiple Languages

If you have movies in multiple languages you have a few options available:

1. Have all in the same folder
2. Split them at the higher level (`movies-en`, `movies-fr`, `movies-de`, ....)
3. Split them at the movie level (`'movies/The Movie (Year) [en]`', '`movies/The Movie (Year) [jp]`'
4. Split them at the higher level (`root/videos/german/{movies,tv..}`)

This depends how many languages you maintain and how much work you want to put into this. Usually it is enough to have 1 folder `movies` with sub-folders of the actual movie title and then throw everything in there.
