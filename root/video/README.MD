## Content

*There is a wide range of types:*

Movies, Movie Shorts, Music Videos, Tv-Shows, Documentaries, learning/tutorials, webisodes, dvd extras (making of), real-live captures, vlogs, let's plays, and more..  

The most important are probably Movies and TV-Shows

* Should not be splitted too far
* TV Shows and Anime ? Together in 1 Directory or splitted?
* TV Shows and Web-Series (Youtube Series, inofficial stuff) - splitted?

## Sub-Sections

## Patterns

→ Currently we use 'movies' because it's more widely adapted instead of 'film'

→ `Short Films` should be integrated into the `movies` folder, but can also be put into a seperate `movie-shorts` or `shorts` directory. If really necessary even `short-films` would work.
