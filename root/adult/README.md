## Content

The adult section contains any kind of material that portrays a sexual subject matter and is intended for sexual arousal. This is primarily seperated from the main filetree to prevent it from being scattered among other files due to its very specific purpose. Pornographic content has a wide range of file types, with images and videos being the most common. Erotica can also come under this category.
