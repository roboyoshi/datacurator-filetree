# Photos

> Images taken from a digital camera or digitized versions of analog photographs.



## Structure

This Section can get pretty personal, so this depends on use-cases again. If you are simply archiving a ton of photographs from a multitude of sources, try going for a year/month/day pattern and give each photo a date+hash combo to find duplicates more quickly. You can find tools for that as well.

If you are curating a personal collection of photos you can invest a lot of time and create events arranged by year/month, but I usually recommend the broadly accepted: `year/yyyy-mm-dd` or `year/mm/dd` pattern.
