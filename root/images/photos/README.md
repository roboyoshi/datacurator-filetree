# Photos

> Images taken from a digital camera or digitized versions of analog photographs.

## Structure

This Section can get pretty personal, so this depends on use-cases again. If you are simply archiving a ton of photographs from a multitude of sources, try going for a year/month/day pattern and give each photo a date+hash combo to find duplicates more quickly. You can find tools for that as well.

If you are curating a personal collection of photos you can invest a lot of time and create events arranged by year/month, but I usually recommend the broadly accepted: `year/yyyy-mm-dd` or `year/mm/dd` pattern.

Example 1:

```i
2019/
  12/
    31/
      20201231-0631-cf4db6fe.jpg
```

Example 2:

```md
2019/
  2019-05-25/
    7K4A8146.jpg

    IMG_0181.JPG
    IMG_0182.MOV
