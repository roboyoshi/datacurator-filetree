# Soundtracks

> Music and sound specifically created/composed/compiled for a movie, television show or videogame etc.



**NOTE:**

This folder is pretty much **optional**. Every Soundtrack usually comes with an album-artist, composer, artist, etc.

This folder only exists for people who like to separate the common `artist - album` releases from soundtracks specifically. Reasons vary, but you can usually find things faster when it's splitted.
