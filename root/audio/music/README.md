Artist
    \ Artist - Year - Album [SOURCE - FORMAT - RES] {Catalog/Info}
        \ Disc#-Track# - TrackTitle

Notes:

- Artist is case sensitive
- Unicode is possible, if you have problems - refer to plain ASCII
- The `{Catalog/Info}` is optional
  - Should be used if Logs are present or you are 100% sure of the content
  - Almost always applies to CD only
- `Disc#-` is optional if one likes to avoid CD1,CD2 subfolders
  - In case of FLAC+Logfile splitted folders are considered best practice.
