## Content

The archive section has the least strict rules about file allocation for any top-level directory, however, it is still important that it is understood what can go in the section and what cannot. Generally, any particular file that you struggle to allocate to any top-level directory can typically be put into the Archive directory, as those files will typically be for 'archival' purposes. The only potential exception is creative assets, as these can often be actively used, so these could also be split into a new top-level directory if you choose.

## Sub-Sections

| Folder       | Contents                                                              |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| assets       | any useful data/material for projects, may include all file types     |
| backups      | non-filetree backups e.g old phone data                               |
| datasets     | collections of data, typically in tabular format                      |
| web          | snapshots of websites at a specific time                              |
