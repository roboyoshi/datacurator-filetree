## Sub-Sections

→ This Section offers multiple classification systems, ready to unpack and roll.

* [BISAC](https://bisg.org/page/bisacedition) (thanks to [u/hyperclick76](https://www.reddit.com/user/hyperclick76) !)
* [UDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Decimal_Classification#Main_tables) (main tables only .. by u/roboyoshi)
* [LCC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Library_of_Congress_Classification#Classification) (main sections only .. by u/roboyoshi)
* [DDC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dewey_Decimal_Classification#Classes) (main classes only .. by u/roboyoshi)

I'd advise to unpack all and go through them real quick, then choose one of the classification systems that you find fits best to your needs and stick with it if possible. Throw away the rest.

## Patterns

* Check https://bookbrainz.org for Proper Author/Title Naming
* Include ISBN (10 or 13) similar to Music Releases
* Example: J.K. Rowling - Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone [English] {1408845644}
* ISBN-10 can be expanded to ISBN-13 by adding 978: {978-1408845646}

**Naming Ideas:**

	└── Lastname, Firstname
		└── Firstname Lastname - [Book Series #] - Book Title {ISBN}.ext

## Resources

There are several classification systems for libraries to sort and catalog books. (See Wikipedia Link on Library Classifications)
In this repository, we want to use such systems and provide examples on how they would be applied.
