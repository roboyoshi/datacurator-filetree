# Games

> A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, and sometimes used as an educational tool.



For archiving games, we must shift our focus away from the pure videogame section towards the broader landscape that is interactive entertainment. There is a lot to cover, but we try to keep it simple.

If you only use this games folder for videogames, you can remove the other folders and reduce the depth a bit. Each Section here has enough sub-sections to deal with. You can (and should) always keep it as flat as possible until you outgrow that system and need to nest more.

Folder names are intentionally lowercase to not mess with different systems and to have a cli friendy structure. You can change that if you wish to, especially further down e.g. on the individual videogame systems or on certain tabletop games. It really depends if you curate for accessiblity or for pure archival.
