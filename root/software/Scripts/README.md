# ./software/scripts

This subdirectory exists for those scripts which are valuable in nature and that you would want to keep long term, but which you've written yourself or are otherwise unique. Organization is thus up to you. There is no requirement for subdirectories, especially if you have only a few dozen or less.

Note:  
Remember to strip these scripts of any sensitive usernames or passwords before archiving. If you have to retrieve them from your NAS because they've been lost elsewhere, it will only take a few minutes to add them back in, but it can take years to repair identity theft issues. Do not fool yourself that you've secured your data hoard sufficiently. Use a password manager.
