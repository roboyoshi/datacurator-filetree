Work in progress. Obviously there are many software-y files out there in the world that aren't scripts or operating systems or video games. You've downloaded more than a few of them for wireless routers and for various pieces of hardware. Keeping an archive of them (partial, just those you have used, or full, every version manufacturer has) only makes sense. They belong here. 

How to organize them? No clue. Perhaps manufacturer/model. Will return to this when it's clearer how to proceed.
