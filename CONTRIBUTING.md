# Contribution Guidelines

We are open to anyone willing to contribute. Please feel free to fork & edit as you wish. We appreciate new Input and hope to grow this filetree to eventually satisfy a broad audience.

## Basic Guide

If you want to help out and contribute to this filetree, please follow this basic flow:

* fork this project

* start within the *root* directory → `/root`

* create/extends the folder structure → e.g. `/root/foo/bar`

* make sure the deeply nested folder contains at least one placeholder file → 

  `/root/foo/bar/example.doc`

* add notes with markdown → `README.md` / `notes.md` / `media.md`

* If your are confident with the changes, create a pull request

  into the `wip` (Work-In-Progress) branch.

* If you just want to share your personal filetree,

  please create a new branch on your fork with this pattern:  `user/nickname`

## Issues

We also welcome any discussion in the *issues* section. Feel free to open a new issue if you see something missing or an error. You can also help discuss uncertain topics and contribute by posting your opinion on certain structures/namings/etc.

## Further Notes:

* If you are going to refactor a certain section or want to add a completely new section, we'd appreciate it that you create a feature branch for it, since that makes it a lot easier tracking the project and handling pull-requests.
