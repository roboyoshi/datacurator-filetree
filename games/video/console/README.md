> = Home Video Game Consoles



Potential Folder Names for each Platform/System (short→long)

```ini
ps
playstation
sony-ps
sony-playstation
Sony PlayStation
```

> Use the style that fits your case best. If you have lots of automation, you appreciate the shorter and lowercase+dashed variants. If you want a "nice to browse" collection, choose the longer and explicit style.



Each System Folder may include

- Games

- Firmware
- Homebrew, Hacking
- Instructions, Manuals, Booklets
- Design Documents
